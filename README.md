# JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks - created with Create-React-App

The idea is that this will be a community driven website that lists the majority of JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks.

## Improve our website
Before making any changes, please read the "Priorities" below.
1. Fork our website, make the change, make a pull request.
Or
2. Log a ticket on 'issues'.

## Why create this?
Mainly, to help the community, this is for everyone.
Does this really need an answer? I'm sure I'm not the only one to find that JS is such a powerful language and yet when you come to adding libraries and frameworks, you would like to know your options...
I did a google search for a website that has this idea, listing majority of libraries and frameworks, couldn't find one, I then  asked a question on Reddit to see if others knew of one... the shortened answer I got was "You're right, it is fragmented. "

## Okay, so what's the priority here
1. List as many Libraries / Frameworks as possible
2. Add links to websites for said Libraries and Frameworks
3. Add a short description for Libraries and Frameworks
4. Add a search box that searches through the list, to make searches easier, add tags to each library framework such as "Game", "Gaming", "Animation", "Animate" etc.
5. That's all I got so far, any suggestions welcome

## So how's this going to work?
For the time being I've created the template of the website, I'd community members to fork this, make changes and then do a merge request, I will review and then either accept or reject it. 
Over time I will add people to help manage this, to make it more manageable especially if it gets popular, which I hope it will.

## Personal Preference
This website will have Bootstrap 4 and it's dependancies, I would appreciate it if we kept it like this for the time being so I understand the code. As my knowledge progresses we can change the way the website is made.

## What's to stop me forking the project and making another version of the project?
Nothing... but I would prefer you didn't as the reason for doing this is to stop fragmentation, if there's more than one of these sites it will cause confusion between the community and thus we're back at square one.

## What's the future of the project
If this becomes popular, I will be buying a domain for it and putting out a survey on what the community thinks should be the domain if available.
